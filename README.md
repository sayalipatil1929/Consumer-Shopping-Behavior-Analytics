# 📊 Consumer Shopping Behavior Analytics
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping patterns to help a retail business understand its consumers and make data-driven strategic decisions. The goal is to uncover purchase trends across demographics, product categories, spending habits, and customer segments to support better marketing, improved customer engagement, and increased revenue.
 Using real-world customer shopping behavior data, this project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into meaningful business insights through data processing, database querying, and interactive visualization.
# The workflow includes:
* Data preparation and transformation using Python
* Structured querying and analysis using SQL
* Interactive dashboard development using Power BI <br>

# 🛠️ 1.Data Preparation & Transformation
* Loaded and inspected the dataset to understand data types, missing values, and structure before processing.
* Cleaned and standardized categorical fields (such as Gender, Category, Payment Method, Size, and Location) to ensure consistency in analysis.
* Handled missing and duplicate records to improve data quality and ensure accurate insights.
* Converted relevant columns to correct data types (numeric formatting for purchase amount and categorical encoding where needed).
* Created additional derived fields to support analysis, such as customer segmentation and grouping for Power BI visuals.
